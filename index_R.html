    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The World Animal Foundation lists 289 species in the genus Octopoda. The Greek word októpus, which means "eight foot," is where the term "octopus" originates.The limbs of the majority of octopus species include suction cups.
        They are arms, not tentacles, as some people mistakenly believe. Their brain is in their eight arms. Rather than in their skull, octopuses' limbs contain two-thirds of their neurons. They may use one arm to find food and the other to perform other chores with its assistance.
        Because of the sensors on their suckers, octopuses can taste whatever they come into contact with, which enhances their keen sense of touch. With a bulbous head, big eyes, and a mouth like a beak, octopuses have a soft, boneless body.
        Because of their absence of a hard backbone, they are renowned for their extraordinary suppleness and agility.

    <h2>Three Hearts</h2>
    <p >A Three hearts are in total in an octopus. Two of them use their gills to pump blood through their organs, while the first one uses its organs. The reason for their blue blood is hemocyanin known as a copper-based protein present in them. An octopus's heart,
        which pumps blood to its organs, stops pumping when it swims. because of this they easily get exhausted, and due to that, they crawl instead of swimming. Octopus has nine brains as well. the main work is done by their ninth brain which is used to control their all-over system and their other eight brains.
        An octopus is said to have the same amount of neurons as a dog.

    <h2>Size</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Octopuses come in various sizes.The average octopus has a length of 30.5 to 91.4 cm and a weight of 3 to 10 kg.
        The biggest octopus is the enormous Pacific pctopus.They can reach a maximum length of 16 feet and a maximum weight of 50 kg, yet one individual weighed almost 272 kg and had a diameter of 30 feet.
        <br>
        The smallest octopus is the <i>Octopus Wolfi.</i> It is shorter than an inch and weighs less than gram.<br>

<section id="habitat"><hr>
    <h2>Habits</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Octopuses are creatures of autonomy that appreciate living alone most of the time. They also have a preference for isolation. And when they choose to socialize it's like a mysterious underwater get-together.<br>
        As a night owl, they take pleasure in using their acute senses to glide smoothly across the water when hunting at night.<br>
        They have a special technique that they use when they are threatened. For instance, if they are disturbed in any way, they can quickly escape by squirting a cloud of completely dark gloom and flashing.<br>
        In addition, they can change hue, allowing them to blend in perfectly with their environment if they detect danger they lose arm.<br>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        The marine creatures known as octopuses are part of the larger family of animals called "Cephalopods," which also includes squids and cuttlefish. ⁤⁤These invertebrates are soft and boneless, just like squids and snails.
        ⁤⁤But octopuses have a couple problems to contend with: a lot of them are caught for food, which damages their habitats, and pollution in the water. ⁤⁤Scientists are trying to create safe zones in the ocean where they may live in peace in order to safeguard them.
        ⁤⁤Scientists are working to trap octopuses in a way that doesn't harm their population in addition to learning more about them to better protect them. ⁤⁤Increasing octopuses' use as aquatic creatures requires ensuring their safety.(Bradford, 2022)<br>
